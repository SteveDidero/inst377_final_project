            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>Our tool allows users to select their destination country and get the current exchange rate between their base currency (USD) and the local currency. With this information, users can estimate how much money they should bring for their trip and avoid unexpected financial issues while abroad.</p>
            
            <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
            <p>Understanding the exchange rate can prevent costly mistakes. By using our service, travelers are better informed and can make smarter decisions about their spending, ensuring a more enjoyable and stress-free vacation.</p>
